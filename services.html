    <td>Mediumship sessions can be done in individual or group settings. Readings are a way to connect with departed loved ones.
Sessions can last from 1-3 hours. Groups of 3+ eligible for group pricing.</td>
    <td>A print of your palm will be made and analyzed with you in real time. We will discuss all major lines as well as minor aspects, and interpret how these affect your life.</td>

The remainder of the smudge stick will be given to you to continue the rituals on your own.</td>
